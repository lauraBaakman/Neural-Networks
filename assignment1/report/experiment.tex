Since \autoref{eq:1:lsChance} only holds when the points are general position we sampled them from a Gaussian distribution \cite[Chapter~5]{prince2012computer}. In these experiments we have made the number of patterns dependent upon some parameter $\alpha$ according to: 
	\begin{equation}
		N = \alpha d
	\end{equation}

\subsection*{Experiment I}
For the first experiment we have generated five hundred 50-dimensional random data sets. 

\subsection*{Experiment II}
