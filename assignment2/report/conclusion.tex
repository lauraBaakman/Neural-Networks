\todo[inline]{Vergelijking met perceptron}

\todo[inline]{The preceptron trained with Minover takes longer to converge than a perceptron trained with the Rosenblat algorithm since the Minover algorithm continues even when the student perceptron gives the same output as the teacher percpetron for each pattern.} 
\todo[inline]{Only difference between rosenblatt and minover is which patterns are used for update and when the algorithm converges}
