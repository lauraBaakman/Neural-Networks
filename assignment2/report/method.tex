Given a dichotemy $\mathcal{D} = \left\{\xi^i, S^i \right\}_{i}^{N}$, $N$ $d$-dimensional patterns $\xi \in \mathcal{R}^d$, each with in contrast to the Rosenblatt algorithm where the labels were assigned randomly, a training label is defined by a teacher perceptron as:
\begin{equation}
	S^\mu = \text{sign}(\vec{w}^* \cdot {\vec{\xi}}^{\mu})
\end{equation}
The $\vec{w}^*$ can be chosen randomly or could be fixed, without loss of generality because the optimal solution is unique. \todo[inline]{because reasons... ofzo}.
