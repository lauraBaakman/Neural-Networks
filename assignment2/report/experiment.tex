The performance of the perceptron trained with the Minover algorithm can be measured using the generalization error defined in \autoref{eq:method:generalization_error}. To explore the behaviour of the Minover algorithm discussed in section \ref{s:method} we have tested a perceptron trained with this algorithm on several $N$-dimensional datasets with $P = \alpha N$, for $N = 10$ and $\alpha = 0.25, 0.5, \dotsc, 5$. To ensure that the dataset was linearly separable we have determiend its labels via \eqref{
